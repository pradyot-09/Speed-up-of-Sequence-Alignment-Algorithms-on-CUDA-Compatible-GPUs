Research Topic: Speed-up of Sequence Alignment Algorithms on CUDA Compatible GPUs

- Abstract: 

GPU has evolved through the years to have
applications in new domains such as Bioinformatics. The
computational power required by these domains often exceeds that
available on traditional CPUs. An emerging alternative is
represented by General Purpose scientific computing on Graphics
Processing Unit (GPGPU). The aim of this paper is to provide a
comprehensive comparison of serial and parallel implementations
of well-known Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithms
and study their behaviour on different GPU architectures. A
major computational approach for solving the LCS problem is
dynamic programming. Many dynamic programming methods
have been proposed to have reduced time and space complexity.
The succeeding topics explores the proposed dynamic
programming solutions to Sequence Alignment problem and our
approach for parallelization of the discussed solutions.
